# [Iris Flowers - Machine Learning](https://github.com/stefanalytical/iris-flowers.git)
 
This is my first project using machine learning.
 
## About
 
I chose the iris flowers dataset because it is considered a great starting point for any data scientist looking to take on their first machine learning project. It is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper _The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems_ as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

In this project I:

1. Installed SciPy as it as the most useful package for machine learning.
2. Loaded the dataset and used statistical summaries and data visualizations to understand it.
3. Created 5 ML models and picked the optimal one while ensuring the accuracy is reliable.

## ML Models

1. **Logistic Regression 'LR'**. Simple linear algorithm. (Estimated accuracy score of 94.2%)
2. **Linear Discriminant Analysis 'LDA'**. Simple linear algorithm. (Estimated accuracy score of 97.5%)
3. **Classification and Regression Trees 'CART'**. Nonlinear algorithm. (Estimated accuracy score of 93.3%)
4. **Gaussian Naive Bayes. Nonlinear algorithm 'NB'**. (Estimated accuracy score of 95%)
5. **Support Vector Machines. Nonlinear algorithm 'SVM'**. (Estimated accuracy score of 98.3%)
